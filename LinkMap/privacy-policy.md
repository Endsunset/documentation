# LinkMap Privacy Policy

- **Last Updated:** Jan 28, 2026
- **Effective Date:** May 31, 2025

## 1. Overview

- LinkMap ("the App", "we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

## 2. Data Collection

- Data is not collected from this app.

## 3. Third-Party Services

To provide core functionality, LinkMap integrates with the following services provided by Apple Inc.:

- **iCloud (CloudKit) – As a Data Processor:**
    We use **Apple's iCloud service (via the CloudKit framework)** to securely store and synchronize your user-generated content and app preferences across your devices. When you enable sync, your data is stored on Apple's servers and processed according to their [iCloud Terms and Conditions](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/). In this context, Apple acts as a **data processor** on our behalf for this specific, contracted service.

- **Apple Maps (MapKit) – As an Independent Data Controller:**
    The App uses **Apple's MapKit framework** to provide mapping and location search features. When you perform a search or interact with the map, those requests are sent **directly to Apple**. Apple processes this data independently to provide the map service. For this data, Apple acts as an **independent data controller**, and their handling of location and search query data is governed solely by their own [Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).

## 4. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices. When we do:

- We will post the new policy with a revised "Last Updated" date
- Material changes will be notified through the App Store listing
- Your continued use after changes constitutes acceptance
